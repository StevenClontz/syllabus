\textbf{Attendance:} \\
Attendance will be recorded at the beginning of each class. Students
who enter after roll is called are marked as absent. Any student who
disrupts class will be asked to leave and will be marked as absence.

If you need to miss
class for a reasonable conflict (athletics, etc.) you are encouraged to
have the absence excused by providing documentation to
Dr. Clontz at least one week in advance.
If you miss class due to illness, you must email Dr. Clontz as soon as
possible and provide written
documentation from a medical professional within one week of the absence
for the absence to be considered excused.

\textbf{Homework:} \\
Homework will be assigned throughout class, and is highly recommended.
The instructor will give feedback on worked homework problems during office
hours.

\textbf{Office Hours:} \\
Students are encouraged to meet with Dr. Clontz during office hours
for help on assigned homework and other feedback on class material.
To meet during office hours, a student should have no more than two unexcused
absences and bring previously attempted solutions to relevant homework problems.
Office hours are not held on the day of a test.

\textbf{Calculators:} \\
Calculators are not necessary and not allowed on any test or exam. Note that
it's possible homework assigned from the textbook may be tedious without the
aid of a calculator.

\textbf{Open-note policy:} \\
Students may use handwritten notes during tests and exams that they have
prepared themselves. Students using notes may be required to turn them
in with the exam and/or prove that the handwriting is their own.
All other documents/devices must be put away during the entire examination.

\textbf{Moodle:}\\
Grades, a class calendar, and possibly other materials will be posted
online to Moodle.
