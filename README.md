# syllabus

This is a LaTeX template for a syllabus. It used to be
[custom to my department at Auburn University](https://github.com/StevenClontz/auburn-math-syllabus/),
but I'm redesigning it to be more general.

[Here's what the finished product looks like.](https://github.com/StevenClontz/syllabus/blob/master/syllabus.pdf?raw=true)

## How to Use

Download the ZIP of files, and open up `syllabus.tex` in your favorite TeX editor. Change all the variables to fit your course, and then compile to PDF.

#### Comfortable with Git?

I've set `.gitignore` to ignore a semesters folder, so here's my workflow:

* Clone the repo as your `master` branch
* `git checkout semester-specific-branch-name` to make a new branch for
  the semester
* Update `syllabus.tex` to fit your course.

## How to Contribute

If you are comfortable with GitHub you are free to submit a Pull Request, or
I'd probably be happy to give you edit privileges to the repo directly.
